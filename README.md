# Classification-and-Fischer-Discriminant-Analysis

There are 3 main files that you have to run:

1) LeastSquaresClassificationMAIN.m
   This code has been divided into 3 sections corresponding to 3 datasets. Please run section by section.
	Functions used by this program:
	  a) loadDataset()
	  b) LeastSquareClassifierFunction()
	  c) binaryCodedTarget()
	  d) linearDisc()
Description for each function used is given in the function code itself. 

2) FisherDiscriminantMAIN.m
   This code has been divided into 3 sections corresponding to 3 datasets. Please run section by section. 
	Functions used by this program:
	  a) loadDataset()
	  b) fisherLDA()
	  c) fisherlinearDisc()
	  d) fisherPredict()
	  e) fisherPredictTaiji() - Only used for Taiji dataset
Description for each function used is given in the function code itself. 

3) LeastSquaresFisherMAIN.m
	Functions used by this program:
	  a) loadDataset()
	  b) LeastSquaresClassifierFunction2()
	  c) fisherLDA()
Description for each function used is given in the function code itself. 
 
Note: 1) The dataset files have not been attached.
      2) Since wine data set has a inbuilt shuffling of data, the accuracy and plots keep changing with each run.
